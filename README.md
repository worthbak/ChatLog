# ChatLog
An app for collecting a history of conversations. 

Please [click here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nocrdiyu0osq80a/ChatLog-WalkthroughVideo.mov?dl=0) for a walkthrough of the app.

## Purpose
This project serves two purposes: the first is, of course, the functionality of the app itself, described below. The second is for the author to demonstrate his expertise in iOS development by producing quality work under a specified amount of time (1/2 of a day). The project began just before 8am on Thursday, March 3rd, and will be completed and sent to relevant parties before 1pm on the same day.

Given the second purpose, a demonstration of expertise in modern iOS app architecure and development, priority will be given to clean code rather than deep functionality. The final app should be simple, with a code structure that would make it easy to modify or add functionality in the future. 

## Core Functionality
In a sentence, ChatLog is an app designed to give users an easy way to record, quantify, and keep track of conversations they have in the real world with real people. It is designed to be simple and to-the-point, with a single primary view for checking out the conversations that were recorded on any given day, and for quickly noting and describing a new conversation. All of this data is quickly observable from the primary view. 

## Potential Functionality
The app will be designed such that new funcionality could be included easily, given more time. This functionality could include: 

- Deeper metadata for each conversation, and the ability to rate each conversation based on its content
- Tagging conversations to a location with Foursquare API integration
- Viewing all conversations across time on a map
- Viewing conversations outside of the current week
- Editing conversations after they've been created
- Simple on-boarding
- Local caching of conversations for persistence across sessions
- Account-based sync to a cloud infrastructure
